This patch file will always spawn jugg as the perk on MOON. 
This is used for playing No Mans Land NML. 
It's 50% chance Jugg, 50% change Speedcola. 
This is just annoying to restart constantly. Use this patch to always give jugg. 
When you get 15 speedcolas in a row you understand the pain of NML.  
 
Step 1: Download zip 
Step 2: upzip 
Step 3: copy and replace zombie_moon_patch.ff file from "patch" folder into the folder: 
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Call of Duty Black Ops\zone\Common  

Or to locate this folder: Steam library -> Right click Bo1 -> properties -> local files -> browse local files -> zone -> common  

Step 4: startup Moon NML and you are good to go  

This patch in the "original" folder is the original patch if you need to change it back. 
You should know that you won't be able to play with this patch coop unless both players have the patch file. 
The patch ONLY changes the perk spawn. 
Only use this for NML. Don't use it for Moon high round games.
