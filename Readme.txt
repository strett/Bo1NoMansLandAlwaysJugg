 <br>
This patch file will always spawn jugg as the perk on MOON. <br>
This is used for playing No Mans Land NML. <br>
It's 50% chance Jugg, 50% change Speedcola. <br>
This is just annoying to restart constantly. Use this patch to always give jugg. <br>
When you get 15 speedcolas in a row you understand the pain of NML.  <br>
 <br>
Step 1: Download zip <br>
Step 2: upzip <br>
Step 3: copy and replace zombie_moon_patch.ff file from "patch" folder into the folder: <br>
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Call of Duty Black Ops\zone\Common  <br>

Or to locate this folder: Steam library -> Right click Bo1 -> properties -> local files -> browse local files -> zone -> common  <br>

Step 4: startup Moon NML and you are good to go  <br>

This patch in the "original" folder is the original patch if you need to change it back. <br>
You should know that you won't be able to play with this patch coop unless both players have the patch file. <br>
The patch ONLY changes the perk spawn. <br>
Only use this for NML. Don't use it for Moon high round games. <br>
